====> Random Sphere

This is not a good topology: you need many points and the surface has areas of much higher density then others.
This could be solved with a stronger pseudo-random generator, but it would still be bad

        for i in range(res):
        # generate random rotation angle and latitude
        phi = random() * 2 * pi
        latitude = radius * 2*random()-1
        dist = (radius ** 2 - latitude ** 2) ** 0.5

        addVertex([
            cos(phi) * dist,
            sin(phi) * dist,
            latitude
        ])

Faces are created using Delaunay triangulation
